    I&#39;ve used MySQL and MongoDB in the past. But their UX isn&#39;t as good as something like Supabase.

    I&#39;ve never experienced auth being this easy!

## TL;DR

I've tried adding auth to my apps in serveral different ways, but it always feels so much more complicated than it needs to be. I recently tried adding auth to my Next.js application using Supabase and I got it up and running faster than any other solution I've used in the past. Their documentation is outstanding:

### Start with the Next.js Supabase Starter Template

There is a fantastic Next.js starter template that you can use to get started with Supabase auth. It's called <ExternalLink href="https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/supabase-authentication">Supabase Authentication</ExternalLink> and it's the quickest way to get started because it handles the boilerplate code for you.

### Wrap It Up

I hope you found this insightful. Auth is one of those basic building blocks that is needed for most applications and it's always seemed too complicated for such a basic feature. Supabase makes it easy to add auth to your application and it's free to use. I highly recommend you give it a try.

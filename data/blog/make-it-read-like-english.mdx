## TL;DR

There is a lot of advice around software engineering best practices, but I think it can be summed up into "Make It Read Like English".

### So Many "Best Practices" to Remember

I'd bet you've heard of most of these "best practices" throughout your career:
1. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
2. Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
5. Pure Functions/Immutability/Functional Programming

There is nothing wrong with any of these principles. They all have their place in right contexts. It's just a lot to remember.

### "Make It Read Like English"

My favorite "best practice" is the simple statement "Make It Read Like English". I'm not sure where I first heard this, but it's been a guiding principle of how I've been writing code for many years.

The concept is simple. As I read through the code, I want it to read like simple English. By striving for this simple idea, the code you right will automatically follow many of the principles outlined above.


### Wrap It Up

Make Your Code Read Like English. That's it.

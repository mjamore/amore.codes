## TL;DR

The optimal way to center an element in CSS will vary depending on which of the following circumstances apply to your situation:

1. Do you want to center the element horizontally or vertically (or both)?
2. Are you trying to center a block element or an inline element?
3. Do you know the width/height of the element or not.

Overall, in modern browsers, <a className="internal-link" href="#option-1-css-grid">CSS Grid</a> or <a className="internal-link" href="#option-2-flexbox">Flexbox</a> are great catch-all solutions.

<Tip text='TIP: Find the scenario below that is applicable to your situation.' />

### Scenario 1: Aligning an Inline Element Horizontally

It's relatively easy to horizontally center an inline element (`a`, `code`, `button`, `input`, `label`, `select`, `span`, `textarea`, <ExternalLink href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#list_of_inline_elements'>etc.</ExternalLink>). Only one CSS declaration is needed: `text-align: center`. Despite the name, this declaration will center any inline element, not just text. Here is an example in action:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Inline Horizontal'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPoYQV?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowFullScreen={true}
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/BaPoYQV'>Centering - Inline Horizontal</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use, only 1 line of code

##### Cons:

- Only works with inline elements

### Scenario 2: Child Element Width is Known And Only Needs to be Centered Horizontally

If you find yourself in this situation, consider yourself lucky because the solution is super easy: use `margin: 0 auto`. This works by setting the left and right margins to `auto`, which evenly distributes the horizontal space on either side of the div. Here is a basic example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Untitled'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/YzjyezN?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowFullScreen={true}
>

  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Only centers horizontally
- Only works if the width of the element is known (such as a fixed width image)
- Doesn't work if the element is floated

### Scenario 3: You need to Center an Element Both Horizontally and Vertically

#### <a href="option-1-css-grid">Option 1: CSS Grid</a>

There are a couple different ways to center a child element using CSS Grid, but my favorite is using the <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-items">place-items</ExternalLink> CSS property. This property is a shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`. This means with only two CSS declarations, you can center a child element both horizontally and vertically. Check it out on CodePen:

<iframe
  height='300'
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Grid'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPorLg?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  frameBorder='no'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowFullScreen={true}
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/BaPorLg'>Centering - Grid</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span className='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling loaded in this example. Only the relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements
- Only requires 2 CSS declarations

##### Cons:

- The `place-items` CSS property is <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=place-items'>not supported in IE11</ExternalLink>

#### <a href="option-2-flexbox">Option 2: Flexbox</a>

Another superhero CSS property of the modern CSS era is Flexbox. If you are new to Flexbox, two outstanding resources for learning how it works are <ExternalLink href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>A Complete Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink> and Josh W. Comeau's <ExternalLink href='https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/'>An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink>. There are three critical CSS declarations required on the parent element in order to center a child element(s) using Flexbox, which are: `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center`. Here is an example on CodePen:

<iframe
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Flexbox'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/rNrOppo?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowFullScreen={true}
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/rNrOppo'>Centering - Flexbox</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span className='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling loaded in this example. Only the relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

As you can see, there are some nice benefits to this approach. For one, it only requires adding CSS to the parent element. You don't have to modify the child elements at all. On the other hand, other solutions listed above are a single line, whereas this solution requires _3 whole properties_. `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center` are responsible for centering the child element(s) vertically and horizontally. Flexbox can also be used in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 above, making this a solid go-to option.

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires 3 properties
- <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=flexbox'>Not fully supported in IE</ExternalLink>

### Scenario 4: If None of the Above Options Work...

The last resort option I would choose is using `position: absolute` and the `transform: translate` property. This method requires the parent element to have `position: static` (<ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#values">which it is by default</ExternalLink>) or `position: relative`, then setting the child element to `position: absolute`, as well as setting the `top`, `left`, and `transform` properties, as seen in this example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Absolute'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/JjBYLyL?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  frameBorder='no'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowFullScreen={true}
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/JjBYLyL'>Centering - Absolute</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span className='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling loaded in this example. Only the relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

##### Pros:

- Can be used to center elements vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires the use of several properties (top, left, and transform)
- Requires properties set on both the parent and child elements
- `position: absolute` comes with its own set of problems (removing the element from the document flow, etc.)

### Wrap It Up

The inspiration for this article is the old joke that you're likely familiar with about how difficult it is to center a div in CSS (hence the name of this article). Before CSS Grid and Flexbox came along, centering an element vertically was often achieved using the `position: absolute` and the `transform: translate` property method discussed in the "If None of the Above Options Work..." section above. And before `transform: translate` came along, the `position: absolute` method was even more complicated. So it's understandable why the joke existed.

But times have changed. These days we have powerful CSS properties like CSS Grid and Flexbox, which make centering elements, both horizontally and vertically, rather trivial.

The way I see it, if you just need to center an inline element horizontally, go with the `text-align: center` option. For all other scenarios, CSS Grid or Flexbox should almost always work.

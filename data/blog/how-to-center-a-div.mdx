## TL;DR

The optimal way to center an element in CSS will vary depending on which of the following circumstances apply to your situation:

1. Do you want to center the element horizontally or vertically (or both)?
2. Are you trying to center a block element or an inline element?
3. Do you know the width/height of the element or not.

The most universally applicable solution is Flexbox, which is detailed in option 2 below.

<Tip text='TIP: Find the scenario below that is applicable to your situation.' />

### Scenario 1: Aligning an Inline Element Horizontally

It's relatively easy to horizontally center an inline element (`a`, `code`, `button`, `input`, `label`, `select`, `span`, `textarea`, <ExternalLink href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#list_of_inline_elements'>etc.</ExternalLink>). Only one CSS declaration is needed: `text-align: center`. Despite the name, this declaration will center any inline element, not just text. Here is an example in action:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Inline Horizontal'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPoYQV?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>

  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use, only 1 line of code

##### Cons:

- Only works with inline elements

### Scenario 2: Element Width is Known And It Only Needs to be Centered Horizontally

If you find yourself in this situation, consider yourself lucky because the solution is super easy: use `margin: 0 auto`. This works by setting the left and right margins to `auto`, which evenly distributes the horizonal space on either side of the div. Here is a basic example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Untitled'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/YzjyezN?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/YzjyezN'>Centering - Margin: 0 auto</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Only centers horizontally
- Only works if the width of the element is known (such as a fixed width image)
- Doesn't work if the element is floated

### Scenario 3: You need to Center an Element Both Horizontally and Vertically

Probably the easiest way to center a div in CSS is by leveraging the power Flexbox. If you are new to Flexbox, two outstanding resources for learning how it works are <ExternalLink href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href='https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/'>Josh W. Comeau's An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink>. The critical properties needed to center a div using Flexbox are:

- `display: flex`
- `align-items: center`
- `justify-content: center`

<iframe
  className={'w-full'}
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Flexbox'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/rNrOppo?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/rNrOppo'>Centering - Flexbox</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

As you can see, one nice benefit of this technique is that you only have to apply these 3 properties to the parent element and nothing on the child. The `align-items: center` property centers the child element vertically, and the `justify-content: center` property centers the child element horizontally (assuming `flex-direction: row`).

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires 3 properties
- <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=flexbox'>Not supported in older browsers</ExternalLink> (Less of an issue over time)

### Option 4: `position: absolute` and `transform: translate`

If you want to center an element using a more advanced method, you can use the `position: absolute` and `transform: translate` properties. This method works by setting the position of the element to absolute and using the translate function to center the element. To center a div using this method, you can use the following code:

```css
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

##### Pros:

- Flexible and can be used to center elements vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires the use of additional properties (top, left, and transform)
- May cause issues with other elements on the page

### Wrap It Up

In conclusion, there are several different ways to center a div in CSS. Each method has its own pros and cons, and it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs. If you are looking for a simple solution, you can use the `margin: auto` property. If you are looking for a more advanced solution, you can use the `position: absolute` and `transform: translate` properties. If you are looking for a solution that works with inline elements, you can use the `text-align: center` property. If you are looking for a solution that works with both block and inline elements, you can use the `display: flex` property.

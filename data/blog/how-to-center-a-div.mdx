## TL;DR

The optimal way to center an element in CSS will vary depending on which of the following circumstances apply to your situation:

1. Do you want to center the element horizontally or vertically (or both)?
2. Are you trying to center a block element or an inline element?
3. Do you know the width/height of the element or not.

The most universally applicable solution is Flexbox, which is detailed in option 2 below.

<Tip text='TIP: Find the scenario below that is applicable to your situation.' />

### Scenario 1: Aligning an Inline Element Horizontally

It's relatively easy to horizontally center an inline element (`a`, `code`, `button`, `input`, `label`, `select`, `span`, `textarea`, <ExternalLink href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#list_of_inline_elements'>etc.</ExternalLink>). Only one CSS declaration is needed: `text-align: center`. Despite the name, this declaration will center any inline element, not just text. Here is an example in action:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Inline Horizontal'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPoYQV?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/BaPoYQV'>Centering - Inline Horizontal</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use, only 1 line of code

##### Cons:

- Only works with inline elements

### Scenario 2: Element Width is Known And It Only Needs to be Centered Horizontally

If you find yourself in this situation, consider yourself lucky because the solution is super easy: use `margin: 0 auto`. This works by setting the left and right margins to `auto`, which evenly distributes the horizontal space on either side of the div. Here is a basic example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Untitled'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/YzjyezN?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/YzjyezN'>Centering - Margin: 0 auto</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Only centers horizontally
- Only works if the width of the element is known (such as a fixed width image)
- Doesn't work if the element is floated

### Scenario 3: You need to Center an Element Both Horizontally and Vertically

#### Flexbox

Probably the easiest way to center a div in CSS is by leveraging the power Flexbox. If you are new to Flexbox, two outstanding resources for learning how it works are <ExternalLink href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>A Complete Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink> and Josh W. Comeau's <ExternalLink href='https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/'>An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink>. There are three critical CSS declarations required on the parent element in order to center a child element(s) using Flexbox, which are: `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center`. Here is an example on CodePen:

<iframe
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer w-full'}
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Flexbox'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/rNrOppo?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/rNrOppo'>Centering - Flexbox</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span class='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling being loaded in this example. The only relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

As you can see, there are some nice benefits to this approach. For one, it only requires adding CSS to the parent element. You don't have to modify the child elements at all. On the other hand, other solutions were a single line, whereas this solution requires _3 whole properties_. `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center` are responsible for centering the child element(s) vertically and horizontally. This option covers both scenarios 1 and 2, making this a solid go-to option.

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires 3 properties
- <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=flexbox'>Not supported in older browsers</ExternalLink> (Shouldn't really be much of an issue anymore)

#### Grid

There are a couple different ways to center a child element using CSS Grid, but my favorite is using the place-items CSS property. This property is a shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`. Here is an example:

### If you have no other options...

If you want to center an element using a more advanced method, you can use the `position: absolute` and `transform: translate` properties. This method works by setting the position of the element to absolute and using the translate function to center the element. To center a div using this method, you can use the following code:

```css
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

##### Pros:

- Flexible and can be used to center elements vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires the use of additional properties (top, left, and transform)
- May cause issues with other elements on the page

### Wrap It Up

Did you know that centering a div in CSS used to be considered so difficult that it was often asked as an ice breaker question during job interviews to make both parties laugh? It's true.

Now you know that in the right scenarios, there are simple one or two liners that solve problem and we are lucky enough these days to have Flexbox and CSS grid to handle even the most demanding of div centering needs. Each method has its own pros and cons, and it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs. If you are looking for a simple solution, you can use the `margin: auto` property. If you are looking for a more advanced solution, you can use the `position: absolute` and `transform: translate` properties. If you are looking for a solution that works with inline elements, you can use the `text-align: center` property. If you are looking for a solution that works with both block and inline elements, you can use the `display: flex` property.

## TL;DR

The optimal way to center an element in CSS will vary depending on which of the following circumstances apply to your situation:

1. Do you want to center the element horizontally or vertically (or both)?
2. Are you trying to center a block element or an inline element?
3. Do you know the width/height of the element or not.

But in modern browsers, CSS Grid or Flexbox are great catch-all solutions.

<Tip text='TIP: Find the scenario below that is applicable to your situation.' />

### Scenario 1: Aligning an Inline Element Horizontally

It's relatively easy to horizontally center an inline element (`a`, `code`, `button`, `input`, `label`, `select`, `span`, `textarea`, <ExternalLink href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#list_of_inline_elements'>etc.</ExternalLink>). Only one CSS declaration is needed: `text-align: center`. Despite the name, this declaration will center any inline element, not just text. Here is an example in action:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Inline Horizontal'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPoYQV?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>

  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use, only 1 line of code

##### Cons:

- Only works with inline elements

### Scenario 2: Element Width is Known And It Only Needs to be Centered Horizontally

If you find yourself in this situation, consider yourself lucky because the solution is super easy: use `margin: 0 auto`. This works by setting the left and right margins to `auto`, which evenly distributes the horizontal space on either side of the div. Here is a basic example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Untitled'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/YzjyezN?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>

  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

##### Pros:

- Simple and easy to use
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Only centers horizontally
- Only works if the width of the element is known (such as a fixed width image)
- Doesn't work if the element is floated

### Scenario 3: You need to Center an Element Both Horizontally and Vertically

#### Option 1: CSS Grid

There are a couple different ways to center a child element using CSS Grid, but my favorite is using the <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-items">place-items</ExternalLink> CSS property. This property is a shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`. This means with only two CSS declarations, you can center a child element both horizontally and vertically. Here is an example on CodePen:

<iframe
  height='300'
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Grid'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/BaPorLg?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  frameBorder='no'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/BaPorLg'>Centering - Grid</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span class='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling being loaded in this example. The only relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements
- Only requires 2 CSS declarations

##### Cons:

- The `place-items`` property is <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=place-items'>not supported in IE11</ExternalLink>

#### Option 2: Flexbox

Probably the easiest way to center a div in CSS is by leveraging the power Flexbox. If you are new to Flexbox, two outstanding resources for learning how it works are <ExternalLink href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'>A Complete Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink> and Josh W. Comeau's <ExternalLink href='https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/'>An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</ExternalLink>. There are three critical CSS declarations required on the parent element in order to center a child element(s) using Flexbox, which are: `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center`. Here is an example on CodePen:

<iframe
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  height='300'
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Flexbox'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/rNrOppo?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/rNrOppo'>Centering - Flexbox</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span class='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling being loaded in this example. The only relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

As you can see, there are some nice benefits to this approach. For one, it only requires adding CSS to the parent element. You don't have to modify the child elements at all. On the other hand, other solutions were a single line, whereas this solution requires _3 whole properties_. `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center` are responsible for centering the child element(s) vertically and horizontally. This option covers both scenarios 1 and 2, making this a solid go-to option.

##### Pros:

- Centers elements both vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires 3 properties
- <ExternalLink href='https://caniuse.com/?search=flexbox'>Not supported in older browsers</ExternalLink> (Shouldn't really be much of an issue anymore)

### If you have no other options...

The last resort option I would choose is using `position: absolute` and the `transform: translate` property. This method requires the parent element to have `position: static` (<ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#values">which it should be by default</ExternalLink>) or `position: relative`, then setting the child element to `position: absolute`, as well as setting the `top`, `left`, and `transform` properties, as seen in this example:

<iframe
  height='300'
  className={'iframe-with-disclaimer'}
  scrolling='no'
  title='Centering - Absolute'
  src='https://codepen.io/mjamore/embed/JjBYLyL?default-tab=css%2Cresult&editable=true'
  frameBorder='no'
  loading='lazy'
  allowtransparency='true'
  allowfullscreen='true'
>
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore/pen/JjBYLyL'>Centering - Absolute</a> by Michael Amore (<a href='https://codepen.io/mjamore'>@mjamore</a>) on{' '}
  <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<span class='iframe-disclaimer'>**Note:** There is additional styling being loaded in this example. The only relevant CSS is displayed for demonstration purposes.</span>

##### Pros:

- Can be used to center elements vertically and horizontally
- Works with both block and inline elements

##### Cons:

- Requires the use of several properties (top, left, and transform)
- Requires properties set on both the parent and child elements
- `position: absolute` comes with its own set of problems (removing the element from the document flow, etc.)

### Wrap It Up

This article is based on the old joke about how difficult it is to center a div in CSS. The reality is, in particular scenarios where you just need to horizontally center an element, it's a simple one or two liner. For anything more complicated, we are fortunate enough these days to have the all-encompassing power of Flexbox and CSS Grid. Each method has its own pros and cons, you just need to choose the right tool for the job.

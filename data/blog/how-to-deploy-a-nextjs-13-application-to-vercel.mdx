## TL;DR

Vercel is the quickest and easiest way to deploy a Next.js application. With a few quick steps, your application is up and running on scalable cloud infrastructure and updates every time you push your code.

- Create your Next.js application and push it to GitHub
- Use Vercel's website to connect Vercel to your GitHub repo
- Profit

### What Makes Vercel a Great Option for Hosting for Your Next.js Application?

Vercel is the company that funds the development of Next.js and one of the core features of Next.js is the developer experience. So by extension, Vercel's integration with Next.js is first class (although you can deploy many other kinds of projects too). If you haven't tried Vercel as a hosting solution for your Next.js application, you're missing out. I'm hoping this article will convince you to give it a try.

### Start a New Next.js Project and Push it to Your GitHub Account

There are a few ways to get started with a Next.js application. You can fork the git repo of an existing <ExternalLink href='https://vercel.com/templates'>
Next.js template</ExternalLink> or you can create a new NextJS application using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

If you create a new Next.js application, you'll need initialize a new git repository (`git init`) and push it to your GitHub account.

### Connect Vercel to Your Git Repository

If you don't already have a Vercel account, <ExternalLink href='https://vercel.com/signup'>create one</ExternalLink>. It's free (no credit card required) and they provide you with free, scalable cloud infrastructure. You have nothing to lose.

You will need to grant Vercel access to your GitHub repository, so I'd recommend choosing GitHub to log into Vercel as well. Once you're logged into Vercel, go to your <ExternalLink href='https://vercel.com/dashboard'>dashboard page</ExternalLink>. Create a new project by clicking the "Add New..." button
and then selecting the "Project" option.

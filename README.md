# codewithlove.blog

A blog for documenting my journey in the field of software engineering.

## TO-DO

- Add code snippets with prism
- Create "uses" page
  - on uses.tech
- Add resume on https://read.cv/ and add link to footer
- look into Tailwind variables for things like background color and content width
- create a contact page
- integrate with a db to store blog post view counts

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open site on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

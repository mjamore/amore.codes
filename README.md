# codewithlove.blog

A blog for documenting my journey in the field of software engineering.

## TO-DO

- integrate with a db to store blog post view counts
- check site against https://securityheaders.com/
  - might need updates to next.config.js?
- make sitemap.xml dynamic
- figure out structured data in Next 13

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open site on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
